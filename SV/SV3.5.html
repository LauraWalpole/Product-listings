    Team up with the original first partner Pokémon—Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle—as a new day dawns in Kanto. 
    This new day ushers in opportunities to reunite with old friends, make new partners, and capture every last one of the original 151. Discover the extraordinary Venusaur ex, Charizard ex, and Blastoise ex in special cards with captivating illustrations, and explore the cities and countryside of a reinvigorated land—you might even find the elusive Mew ex in your travels. 
    New adventures will unfold and new horizons will be revealed in the Scarlet & Violet—151 expansion!
